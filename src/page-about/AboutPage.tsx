              This is an interactive model to allow criminal justice leaders and
              their staff to project the likely impact of COVID-19 within
              facilities. The charts and tables project how far into the future
              cases will peak in your facilities and how high that peak will be.
              It also forecasts hospital bed needs, and compares this to the
              number of hospital beds available in your region.

              What makes this model different from the models I see online or in

            <p className="leading-7 text-base sm:text-lg mb-6 font-body">
              This model is similar to models being used publicly, but factors
              in common criminal justice variables (population size and
              potential population releases). <br />
              <br />
              It also uses a rate of spread (R(t), the basic reproductive number
              which estimates the rate of an infection's spread) that is
              specific to prison and jail populations, where airborne illnesses
              spread at a significantly faster rate than is seen in the general
              population. See relevant academic work on the spread of similar
              illnesses in enclosed populations cited in the Methodology
              section.
