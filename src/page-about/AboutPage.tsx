              Poor medical infrastructure and close quarters mean that jails and
              prisons are uniquely susceptible to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because
              the virus has already entered several facilities, state
              governments and corrections leaders need to act fast.{" "}

                This isn’t just their problem; it’s everyone’s. Without proper

              Recidiviz, in collaboration with X and Y, is standardizing and
              tracking those actions that state and county leaders across the
              country have taken to reduce populations and transmission rate.
              Why? Because we believe in transparency, and that knowing what’s
              happening where is helpful to those empowered to take action. In
              the coming days, we’ll add more data sources to this site intended
              to aid decision-makers understand what else they can do and what
              impact those decisions will have both now and in the long run for
              public health and criminal justice alike.
